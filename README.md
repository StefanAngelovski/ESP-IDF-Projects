This repository provides a collection of **reusable ESP-IDF components** designed to streamline development for Espressif IoT platforms. It includes pre-tested modules, drivers, and utilities to simplify integration with sensors, peripherals, and communication protocols, while ensuring compatibility with ESP32/ESP8266 series chips.  

## Purpose  

The goal of this repository is to accelerate embedded development on the ESP-IDF framework by offering **production-ready components** that reduce boilerplate code and debugging time. These modules are rigorously tested to handle common use cases, making it easier to focus on application logic rather than low-level configuration.  

## Features  

- **Modular ESP-IDF components** for sensors, displays, wireless protocols, and system utilities  
- **Pre-configured settings** for GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, and power management  
- Built-in support for **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (BLE/Classic), and IoT cloud services**  
- Examples for integrating peripherals like ADCs, DACs, IMUs, and environmental sensors  
- Emphasis on **low-power operation** and real-time performance  

## Usage  

### 1. Add Components  
Clone the repository or copy specific components to your project:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/StefanAngelovski/ESP-IDF-Projects.git
